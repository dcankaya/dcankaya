### Hi there 👋

#### A burgeoning data scientist with a climate change and sustainability consultancy experience by day ☼ and an Effective Altruist by night ☾

- 🌍 I'm based in **Istanbul, Turkey**
  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Data Science from [Miuul](https://miuul.com) and [İstanbul Kodluyor](https://istanbulkodluyor.com/istanbul-kodluyor)<br>
- 🔭 I’m currently working the bootcamp finishing project (private unfinished repo on a financial dataset)
- ⚙️ I use daily: `.py`, `.ipynb`

- 💬 Ask me about **AI governance**, **statistics**, **finance**, **sustainability**, **design**, **design thinking**

- ⚡ Fun fact: I run two half marathons every year. This year will be the one with a full marathon!
