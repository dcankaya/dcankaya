### Hi there 👋

👩🏻 I'm Dilara. I am a burgeoning data scientist from **Istanbul, Turkey**, where I am about to complete an extensive bootcamp by [Miuul](https://miuul.com) and [İstanbul Kodluyor](https://istanbulkodluyor.com/istanbul-kodluyor). 

🏦 I'm currently working on a financial dataset as my bootcamp finishing project with my two teammates. In March 2024, we also entered our first datathon and *placed first* 🥇! Check out our [Kaggle notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/edacelikeloglu/upschoolxbitexen-datathon-mar24) here. 

💻 I am currently *looking for work* as a junior data scientist. I have an MA in Economics and International Relations. Before falling in love with data, I worked 4 years as a climate change and sustainability consultant in the IFC, EY, and various startups.

💬 Ask me about **AI governance**, **statistics**, **finance**, **sustainability**, **design thinking**, **fitness**. <br>

⚡ Fun fact: I am an Effective Altruist, I lived in Scotland for 4 years, I love playing chess and I run two half marathons every year. This November I will run my first marathon!
