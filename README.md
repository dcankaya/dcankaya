### Hi, I'm Dilara. 👋

🔍 Data Scientist and Economist with a strong foundation in sustainability and innovation, actively seeking new opportunities in the field.

🎓 I recently completed an intensive Data Science bootcamp by Miuul and İstanbul Kodluyor, where I developed my skills in machine learning, data analysis, and Python programming. My background includes an MA in Economics and International Relations, and 4 years of experience as a climate change and sustainability consultant across various sectors, including work with the IFC and EY.

💻 My GitHub projects showcase my passion for leveraging data science to drive positive change. I’m particularly focused on AI governance, financial modeling, and ESG data integration. I enjoy exploring the intersection of technology, policy, finance, and sustainability, and I’m always looking for new challenges.

🌍 With experience working on global projects and living in the UK for 4 years, I bring a diverse and international perspective to my work. I’m eager to collaborate on open-source projects and connect with others interested in making a tangible impact through data science.

💬 Let’s connect and discuss statistics, AI governance, finance, or fitness!
