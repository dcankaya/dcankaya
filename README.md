### Hi there 👋

#### A burgeoning data scientist by day ☼ 
#### and an Effective Altruist by night ☾
  
🌱 I’m currently learning Data Science from [Miuul](https://miuul.com) and [İstanbul Kodluyor](https://istanbulkodluyor.com/istanbul-kodluyor)<br>
🏦 I’m currently working the bootcamp finishing project (private unfinished repo on a financial dataset)

👩🏻‍💼 I have 4 years' experience as a climate change and sustainability consultant in the IFC and EY.

💬 Ask me about **AI governance**, **statistics**, **finance**, **sustainability**, **design**, **design thinking**

⚡ Fun fact: I run two half marathons every year. This year will be the one with a full marathon!
