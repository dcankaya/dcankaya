### Hi, I'm Dilara. 👋

🔍 Data Scientist with an MA in Economics and International Relations, actively seeking new opportunities in the field.

🎓 I recently completed an intensive Data Science bootcamp by [Miuul](https://miuul.com) and [İstanbul Kodluyor](https://istanbulkodluyor.com/istanbul-kodluyor), where I honed my skills in machine learning, data analysis, and Python programming. With 4 years of experience as a climate change and sustainability consultant with the IFC, EY, and various startups, I've developed a keen ability to apply data-driven solutions to real-world challenges.

💻 My latest projects focus on AI governance, financial modeling, and reinforcement learning. I'm particularly interested in deep learning and NLP.

💬 I’m always open to collaboration on open-source projects or discussing topics like statistics, AI governance, finance, and fitness. Let's connect!
