### Hi there 👋

👩🏻 I'm Dilara. I am a data scientist from **Istanbul, Turkey**. 

🎓 I recently completed an extensive bootcamp by [Miuul](https://miuul.com) and [İstanbul Kodluyor](https://istanbulkodluyor.com/istanbul-kodluyor). My team's bootcamp finishing project, called the Churninator and linked below, predicts credit card customer churn. The same team also *placed first* 🥇 on our first datathon with this [Kaggle notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/edacelikeloglu/upschoolxbitexen-datathon-mar24)! 

💻 I am currently *looking for work* as a data scientist. I have an MA in Economics and International Relations. Before falling in love with data, I worked 4 years as a climate change and sustainability consultant in the IFC, EY, and various startups.

💬 Ask me about **AI governance**, **finance**, **sustainability**, **design thinking**, and **fitness**. <br>

⚡ Fun fact: I am an Effective Altruist, I lived in Scotland for 4 years, and this November I will run my first marathon!
