### Hi, I'm Dilara. 👋

🔍 Currently *looking for work* as a data scientist. 

🎓 I recently completed an extensive Data Science bootcamp by [Miuul](https://miuul.com) and [İstanbul Kodluyor](https://istanbulkodluyor.com/istanbul-kodluyor). I have an MA in Economics and International Relations, and a 4-year experience as a climate change and sustainability consultant in the IFC, EY, and various startups.

💬 Ask me about **statistics**, **AI governance**, **finance**, and **fitness**.

⚡ Fun fact: I lived in Scotland for 4 years!
